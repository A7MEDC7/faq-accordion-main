## Features

- Accordion-style FAQ section with collapsible answers.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

To view the FAQ accordion, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also check out the live version hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://a7medc7.github.io/faq-accordion-main/).

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file defining the styles for the webpage.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file handling the accordion functionality.
- `assets`: Directory containing images used in the project.

## Style and Design

The project follows a clean and aesthetic design with a focus on user experience. It utilizes the Work Sans font from Google Fonts and features a color scheme defined in the `:root` CSS section.

### Global Styling

- The background pattern changes based on the device's viewport width.
- The overall layout is contained within a card with a shadow effect for depth.

### Header Styling

- The header displays a title with a star icon, contributing to a visually appealing header section.

### Accordion Section Styling

- Each FAQ item consists of a clickable label and a collapsible content section.
- A plus/minus icon indicates the expand/collapse state of the answer.
- Hover effects enhance the interactivity and user engagement.

### Footer Styling

- The footer includes attribution to Frontend Mentor and the coder, Ahmed Asem.
- It remains fixed at the bottom of the page for easy access.

## Responsive Design

The webpage is responsive and adjusts its layout for different screen sizes. Media queries are used to modify styles based on the viewport width, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
